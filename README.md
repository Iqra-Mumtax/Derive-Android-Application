# Derive-Android-Application
We like to keep a photographic record of our experiences such as outings with friends, unforgettable family excursions and world tours. Thatâ€™s where the Derive application comes in. It acts as a diary where one can record day-to-day activities during outings by capturing photos and jotting down their feelings about the sight. The photos will be geo-tagged using the Google Maps API.
